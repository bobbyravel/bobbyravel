Hi, I'm Bobby Ravel Moreno.
I'm currenlty an undergrad student majoring in computer science. 
I have a great interest in the world of DATA. This started when I entered my 3rd semester of college. 
To be precise, it started when I chose to dive deeper into the world of Artificial Intelligence.
Right now I'm pursuing my dream to become a Data Analyst.
